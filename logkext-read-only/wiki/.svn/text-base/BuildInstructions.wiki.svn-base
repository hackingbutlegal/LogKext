#labels Phase-Implementation
1) Set the build configuration to Development or Deployment. Deployment builds in 32/64bit Intel/PPC universal. Development builds for whatever processor/architecture is currently in use.

1) Compile main project. All subprojects should automatically be compiled.

2) Check build output.  If PackageMaker (last build step) said "Error: source not on disk" or something like that; or if no logkext.pkg exists, the build didn't fully complete.  In this case, you need to just run the build again and it should work.

*** NOTE: Currently due to  [http://code.google.com/p/logkext/issues/detail?id=30 issue 30], this won't work properly. Follow the workaround in the issue report to build the package correctly.

3) Install logKext.pkg.
